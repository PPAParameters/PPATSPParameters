##Abstract Paper
the performance of the Plant Propagation Algorithm, a crossoverless
metaheuristic, when applied the Euclidean traveling salesman
problem. However, with large volumes of experimental data, a
clearly characterizable relation emerges, facilitating both an exact
parameterization as well as opening up perspectives on a precisely
predictable outcome. These results directly question its position
between exact, approximation, and PTAS algorithms.
Although the metaheuristic is thereby officially parameter sensitive
when deployed to the Euclidean traveling salesman problem, it
does appear to be largely insensitive to different problem instances.
This is very different from earlier results on continuous optimization,
which were completely opposite. Why is that, and what does
it mean for our practices in algorithmic benchmarking?
